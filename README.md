# Soil-Compost-Sensor
Making own version portable Soil Compost sensor for Agriculture uses

Apprently this is consider protype model as requested for client, but feel free to make use of it.

#  The future feature will be added such as:
1. Implement IoT in the system
2. capable to autonomous instead of making it portable
3. implement it sending and receving information to raspberry Pi and phone control

P.s this github manual are not yet finished yet, some changes are will be update,but will try my best to finished it for now..... all the best for developer and user

# Instruction
1. Code in this folder are given, please make sure put it in one folder to use it on arduino.
2. To upload to the arduino. please download first the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
3. Open up the Arduino IDE and located the code file.
4. Install needed libary before uploading the file:
     - Will list down later
5. Upload the code to the mainboard using USB cable

--- The System should work ---
Have a nice gardening :)

# New Update - 9th June 2025
Apperently, I just found out the code I create have a lot of errors. Some of the sensors especially the npk are always getting 255 value or 0 which is logically error.

However I put my latest code that I wrote down, but still in progress to do it.
Feel free to use it.
